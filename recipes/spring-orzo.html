        <p>I thought I had Arborio rice but I obviously did not. Orzo pasta makes a <br>
        delightful risotto with help from spring veggies like asparagus and peas. For <br> 
        service, garnish with some freshly grated Grana Padano cheese and chopped parsley.</p>
        <h2> Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 ½ cups vegetarian chicken-flavored broth </li>
            <li> 2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth </li>
            <li> 3 tablespoons unsalted butter  </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil </li>
            <li> ½ medium yellow onion, diced </li>
            <li> ¾ teaspoon red pepper flakes </li>
            <li> sea salt and cracked black pepper to taste </li>
            <li> 1 medium zucchini, halved lengthwise and sliced </li>
            <li> 2 cups uncooked orzo pasta </li>
            <li> ¼ cup dry white wine </li>
            <li> 1 hard cheese rind </li>
            <li> ½ teaspoon sea salt </li>
            <li> 1 bunch fresh asparagus, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces </li>
            <li>  1 cup frozen peas </li>
            <li>  ½ cup finely grated Grana Padano cheese </li>
            <li>  ½ cup chopped fresh parsley  </li>
            <li>  1 medium lemon, zested and juiced  </li>
       </ul>
       <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Pour vegetarian chicken broth and vegetable broth into a medium saucepan <br>
             over over medium heat; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to simmer and cover until
             <br> needed.    </li> <br>
            <li>  Melt butter and oil together in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Add onion, <br>
             pepper flakes, and a pinch of sea salt and pepper. Cook and stir for about 4 <br>
            minutes before adding the zucchini and another pinch of sea salt. Stir and <br>
            continue to cook for about 3 minutes. Next, stir in the dry orzo pasta and <br>
            continue to cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes.  </li> <br>
            <li>Pour in wine, stirring as it bubbles until the rapid bubbling stops. Pour in hot <br>
            broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat slightly and add cheese rind and 1/2 <br>
            teaspoon sea salt. Cook and stir until a good portion of the liquid has been <br>
            soaked up by the orzo, about 10 minutes. Stir in asparagus and frozen peas and <br>
            continue to simmer until nearly all of the liquid is gone and orzo is fully cooked, <br>
             about 5 minutes. Remove from the heat.    </li> <br>
            <li> Stir in Grana Padano cheese, parsley, lemon zest and juice, and desired amount <br>
            of cracked pepper. Remove and discard cheese rind. Taste and adjust salt and <br>
            pepper as desired.   </li>
        </ol>
